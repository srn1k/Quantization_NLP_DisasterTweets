# Quantization_NLP_DisasterTweets
Quantizing weights for DistilBert model for NLP Disaster Tweets

Main code was borrowed from https://github.com/rasbt/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/blob/main/L19/distilbert-classifier/01_distilbert-simple.ipynb

It's just application of fine-tuning DistilBert for Disaster Tweets with Bitwise quantization of weights
